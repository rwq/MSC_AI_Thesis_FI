**News:** Check our new CVPR 2018 paper on a [faster and higher-quality](http://sniklaus.com/papers/ctxsyn) frame interpolation method.

This is a reference implementation of Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Separable Convolution [1] using PyTorch. Given two frames, it will make use of [adaptive convolution](http://sniklaus.com/papers/adaconv) [2] in a separable manner to interpolate the intermediate frame. Should you be making use of our work, please cite our paper [1].

For a reimplemntation of our work, see: https://github.com/martkartasev/sepconv

And for another adaptation, consider: https://github.com/HyeongminLEE/pytorch-sepconv

## setup
To download the pre-trained models, run `bash download.bash`.

The separable convolution layer is implemented in CUDA using CuPy, which is why CuPy is a required dependency. It can be installed using `pip install cupy` or alternatively using one of the provided binary packages as outlined in the CuPy repository.

If you plan to process videos, then please also make sure to have `pip install moviepy` installed.

## usage
To run it on your own pair of frames, use the following command. You can either select the `l1` or the `lf` model, please see our paper for more details. In short, the `l1` model should be used for quantitative evaluations and the `lf` model for qualitative comparisons.

```
python run.py --model lf --first ./images/first.png --second ./images/second.png --out ./out.png
```

To run in on a video, use the following command.

```
python run.py --model lf --video ./videos/car-turn.mp4 --out ./out.mp4
```

For a quick benchmark using examples from the Middlebury benchmark for optical flow, run `python benchmark.py`. You can use it to easily verify that the provided implementation runs as expected.
